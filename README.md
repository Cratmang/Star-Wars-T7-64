<i>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</i>

<i>Base N, a mining site and treasure vault, has been abandoned for quite some time, minus the presence of a crafty T7 astromech that intends to keep it that way.</i> 

<i>But by some stroke of misfortune, an army of Battle Droids has discovered the lost base, and is hellbent on claiming it, and its treasure. How long can T7-64 defend the base before they break into the vaults and steal everything?</i>
